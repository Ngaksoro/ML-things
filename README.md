# Description 
This repository is especially for the Machine Learning team. Our model is focusing on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition. We apply transfer learning using a pre-trained model called Inception V3 which is provided by TensorFlow. The accuracy is getting 0.9510, and 0.9284 on validation. 

## Technologies
* TensorFlow
* Visual Studio Code

# Documentation
1. Collecting the dataset from Kaggle.com
2. Pre-processing the dataset
3. Create the model using TensorFlow and apply the transfer learning
4. Save the model into .h5 format file
5. Create the function that will test the model using new image
